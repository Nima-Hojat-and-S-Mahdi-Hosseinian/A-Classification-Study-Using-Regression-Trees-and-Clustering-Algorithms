# A-Classification-Study-Using-Regression-Trees-and-Clustering-Algorithms


## Overview

This repository introduces a framework designed to address a persistent challenge in the construction industryâ€”classifying project owners based on their payment histories. The framework utilizes a combination of supervised (regression trees) and unsupervised (k-means clustering) machine learning algorithms to mitigate hindrances in financial forecasts for contractors.

## Key Features

- Classification of project owners into nine distinct groups using regression trees and clustering.
- Utilization of four independent variables for accurate classification.
- Decision tree model achieves an impressive 88% accuracy rate in predicting owner groups.
- Integration of both models enhances accuracy for forecasting payment behavior.

## Benefits

Contractors stand to gain significantly from this framework, enabling them to:

- Make informed decisions regarding risks.
- Enhance precision in cash flow forecasting.

Simultaneously, project owners can:

- Optimize operational strategies.
- Improve payment procedures by benchmarking against industry peers.

## Implementation Details

- Implemented in Python.
- Utilizes two machine learning techniques: decision tree and k-means clustering.
- Evaluation performed using real-world data, ensuring applicability and reliability in diverse construction scenarios.
